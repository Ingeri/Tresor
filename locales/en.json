  "faq-qtn-1": "What services do you offer?",
  "faq-ans-1-p-1": "I offer a combination of modern digital services tailored to support individuals, small businesses, and organizations. My core focus is on web development, creating fast, responsive, and visually clean websites that meet practical needs. Whether it’s a personal site, business presence, or custom web app, I build solutions that align with your goals.",
  "faq-ans-1-p-2": "In addition to development, I provide ICT training to help people become confident in using digital tools, especially beginners who want to learn computer basics, Microsoft Office, or internet essentials. I structure lessons around practical, real-world use, making them easy to understand and apply.",
  "faq-ans-1-p-3": "Lastly, I also manage social media presence for clients who want to grow their audience or improve their communication online. From content strategies to daily posting and audience engagement, I help individuals and brands build consistency and connection on platforms like Instagram and Facebook.",
  "faq-qtn-2": "Are you available for freelance or contract work?",
  "faq-ans-2-p-1": "Yes, I am available for part-time freelance or contract work. I enjoy working on projects that are meaningful and goal-driven, whether short-term or ongoing. If you have a clear idea or just need someone to help you define your goals, I’m open to listening and helping shape the path forward.",
  "faq-ans-2-p-2": "Because I work part-time, I can focus on fewer projects at a time and give each one the attention it deserves. I believe in building long-term professional relationships with my clients, and I’m always honest about timelines and commitments to ensure clarity from the beginning.",
  "faq-ans-2-p-3": "Feel free to reach out even if you’re not sure where to start. Sometimes just having a conversation can reveal how we might work together or if I’m the right fit for your needs.",
  "faq-qtn-3": "How can I contact you?",
  "faq-ans-3-p-1": "The best way to contact me is through email or Instagram, where I’m most active and responsive. Email allows for formal communication and sharing of project details, while Instagram is perfect for quick messages, follow-ups, or getting to know my recent work and style.",
  "faq-ans-3-p-2": "You can send a message directly through the contact form on my website, or reach me via ingeritresor@gmail.com for professional inquiries. I aim to reply to all messages within 1–2 working days.",
  "faq-ans-3-p-3": "Whether you're looking for a project quote, have a question about training, or simply want to collaborate, don't hesitate to get in touch.",
  "faq-qtn-4": "What is your typical project timeline?",
  "faq-ans-4-p-1": "The timeline of a project depends largely on its size, features, and level of customization. For small to medium-sized websites, I typically complete the work in under 6 months, often faster for simpler needs like a personal blog or landing page.",
  "faq-ans-4-p-2": "I start by discussing your vision in detail and planning out phases—from layout to development to testing. The better the preparation, the smoother and quicker the development process. I also communicate consistently along the way so you’re always in the loop.",
  "faq-ans-4-p-3": "I start by discussing your vision in detail and planning out phases—from layout to development to testing. The better the preparation, the smoother and quicker the development process. I also communicate consistently along the way so you’re always in the loop.",
  "faq-qtn-5": "Do you work with clients outside your country?",
  "faq-ans-5-p-1": "Yes, although I’m based in Rwanda, I have experience working with clients internationally. The digital nature of my work allows me to collaborate with anyone around the world through email, video calls, and file sharing platforms.",
  "faq-ans-5-p-2": "Distance doesn’t stop productivity. I maintain professionalism, clear communication, and time zone awareness when working with global clients. I ensure expectations are discussed clearly and documented at the start of every project.",
  "faq-ans-5-p-3": "Whether you're in Rwanda or elsewhere, I’m always open to new challenges and cross-border collaborations.",
  "faq-qtn-6": "What tools and technologies do you specialize in?",
  "faq-ans-6-p-1": "Currently, I focus primarily on Node.js for backend development and general server-side functionality. It’s a flexible and reliable technology for building real-time applications and APIs. I also use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB for full-stack web development.",
  "faq-ans-6-p-2": "Soon, I will be migrating more projects to Next.js, a powerful React framework that enhances performance and SEO. I’m always looking to improve my stack by learning tools that bring speed, scalability, and better user experiences.",
  "faq-ans-6-p-3": "Alongside technical tools, I also manage content and styling through modular CSS, responsive design principles, and database integration for dynamic features like articles, forms, or dashboards.",
  "faq-qtn-7": "Can I see examples of your previous work?",
  "faq-ans-7-p-1": "Yes! One of my favorite projects is a web experience I built called “Zodiac Symbols + Card”. It’s more than just a design—it includes an article section, custom visuals, and meaningful interactions. It’s a great example of my style and ability to combine design with structured content.",
  "faq-ans-7-p-2": "The project shows how I manage everything from layout and visual styling to functional backend features. It also reflects how I handle storytelling, as the content was part of the experience—not just design for design’s sake.",
  "faq-ans-7-p-3": "If you'd like more examples or case studies, I’m happy to share them during a consultation or provide access to private demos depending on the project context.",
  "faq-qtn-8": "Do you offer website maintenance or support after a project is complete?",
  "faq-ans-8-p-1": "Yes, I offer post-project support to help keep your website running smoothly and up-to-date. My goal isn’t just to hand off a finished product—it’s to support its growth. Whether it’s fixing bugs, updating content, or adapting the site to new needs, I’m available to assist.",
  "faq-ans-8-p-2": "If you don’t have a technical background, I can handle all your website maintenance, and if you're learning, I can even guide you on how to manage it yourself. I’m flexible in terms of support arrangements—monthly plans, on-demand help, or scheduled check-ins.",
  "faq-ans-8-p-3": "You can always contact me with new ideas or changes, and I’ll help turn them into working features or improvements.",
  "faq-qtn-9": "What is your pricing or rate structure?",
  "faq-ans-9-p-1": "My pricing is flexible and based on the size and quality of the project you need. I believe every project is unique—some require more design, others need deeper functionality or long-term planning. That’s why I prefer to assess each project individually before giving a final quote.",
  "faq-ans-9-p-2": "I can work on a per-project basis or in stages, especially for larger builds. For smaller jobs or training sessions, we can agree on a simple rate or package. I try to keep my pricing fair and transparent, with no hidden costs.",
  "faq-ans-9-p-3": "During the consultation, I’ll walk you through what’s included and help you prioritize what’s most important for your budget and goals.",
  "faq-qtn-10": "Can we schedule a consultation before starting a project?",
  "faq-ans-10-p-1": "Absolutely. I always encourage a free consultation or discovery session before jumping into any project. This is a relaxed conversation where you share your idea, and I give feedback on what’s possible, what tools we might use, and how long it might take.",
  "faq-ans-10-p-2": "This also helps both of us understand if we’re a good match. I’ll ask a few questions about your goals, your timeline, and your audience so I can give meaningful suggestions—even if you’re just exploring your options.",
  "faq-ans-10-p-3": "You can schedule a consultation by emailing me or messaging me on Instagram. We’ll find a time that works for both of us and go from there."
