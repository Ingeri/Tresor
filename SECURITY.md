# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for actively maintained versions of the website and related applications.

| Component / Version           | Supported? |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| Main website (live)           | ✅ Yes    |
| Legacy branches / experiments | ❌ No     |

If your deployment diverges significantly (custom modules, forks, or third-party integrations), please assume it is unsupported unless confirmed otherwise.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue in the website, code, or any of its public-facing applications (e-learning, AI assistant, etc.), please follow these steps:

1. **Do not publish a public issue or disclose details publicly first.**
   Let us address the problem responsibly before broad disclosure.

2. **Contact via email:**
   `security@ingeri.netlify.app` *(or use an alternate security-specific email such as `security@ingeri.com` if preferred)*

3. **What to include in your report:**

   * A concise title and summary of the vulnerability
   * Steps to reproduce (if possible)
   * Environment / context in which the issue occurs (browser, version, platform, etc.)
   * Any proof-of-concept or minimal code sample (if available)
   * Your suggested mitigation(s), if you have one
   * Whether you want credit (name/alias) in public acknowledgments, or remain anonymous

4. **Response / timeline:**

   * Acknowledgment of receipt: within **48 hours**
   * Status update / initial feedback: within **5 business days**
   * If confirmed: fix deployment timeline depends on severity; we aim for the **soonest possible release**
   * After patching: we will inform you and, with your permission, credit your contribution

5. **Credit and disclosure:**
   With your consent, we may credit you in release notes or on a “security acknowledgments” page.
   We reserve the right to delay public disclosure until users are protected.

6. **Legal safe harbor (optional):**
   So long as your report is made in good faith, without malicious intent or breaking laws, you will not face legal action for responsible disclosure.
